The homework assignment for week 1

## Description

This project was created to put all the pieces of basic HTML and CSS knowledge in practice. The primary changes made were comments added, CSS elements simplified and made more intuitive, and alt text added to images.

## Installation

NA

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To utilize this webpage, I recommend opening up the page in google chrome and using the 'inspect element' tool to see the code responsible for the content and layout of the page. The comments will be denoted by <!-- --> in HTML and by /* */ in CSS. The comments will give additional insights into the function of each element of code.
